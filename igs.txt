Notes

I feel we have left the problem of worldFolds Unresolved, being how can we deal with a living nonContainer attempting to carry something.

Essentially we want different behaviour of the doAction Function based on the constraints satisfied by a given object

i.e. 

doGet :: World

Or rather, it might be better for us, given that we are separating lexer from parser. To create actions as sourced

i.e. Action = Target TokenCollection 

where Target is the source actor, with the idea that we can then check for constraint via worldFolding to find the source, failure means failure on constraint.
